# TiDEomics: Time-course Differential Expression analysis of omics data

`TiDEomics` provides an integrated framework for **Ti**me-course
**D**ifferential **E**xpression analysis of **omics** data with
**multiple experimental groups / conditions**.

`TiDEomics` enables:

- Analysis of feature x sample format data from different omics
  technologies.
- Comparison of multiple (more than two) time courses systematically.
- Filtering of features by residual variance, accounting for group and
  temporal structure.
- Identification of features (e.g. genes, proteins) and pathways
  differentially expressed by **time**, **group**, and **both** factors
  (time x group interactions).
- Integration of quality control, data processing, sample-level and
  feature-level analysis, tailored for time-course multi-condition data.
- Functional enrichment with high-quality visualisation.

Existing time-course analysis tools typically focus on a single analysis
step or are limited to two-group designs or transcriptomics input, and
do not provide an integrated workflow.

Example applications include:

- Transcriptomics analysis of a cell type’s response to different
  stimuli over time.
- Proteomics analysis of wild type and multiple mutant cell lines
  sampled at several time points.

`TiDEomics` supports datasets with missing values (e.g. mass
spectrometry-based proteomics), and operates on `SummarizedExperiment`
objects to ensure compatibility with the Bioconductor ecosystem.

`TiDEomics` supports both independent-sample designs (e.g. cell culture)
and repeated-measures designs (e.g. patient longitudinal studies, via
`subject_col` in
[`create_input()`](https://hte123.github.io/TiDEomics/reference/create_input.md)).
Downstream functions auto-detect the data structure.

## Installation

Get the latest stable `R` release from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `TiDEomics` from
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("TiDEomics")
```

The development version can be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/hte123/TiDEomics) with:

``` r
if (!require("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("hte123/TiDEomics")
```

## Example

For detailed examples and explanations, please refer to the
[tutorial](https://hte123.github.io/TiDEomics/articles/TiDEomics.html),
applications and other package documentation.
